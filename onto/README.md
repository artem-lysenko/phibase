Several classes are native (I could not find anything suitable to import) and we have to define it by ourselves. I attempted to make some definitions. these terms are marked with '?' in the second column.

Please check and suggest definitions. For example 'disruption'.

Please also comment on the suggested relations (we discussed it last time). relations are also marked with '?'.

The updated ontology is also in the git repository. But it requires more work. It is surprisingly small now. I plan to add classes from the plant ontology, more organisms. I will go through all documents I have for phibase and will make sure that all terms are in the ontology
