- this php sparql client uses the "Simple library to query SPARQL from PHP sparqllib.php"
- more info here: http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/sparqllib/

- index.php has the form where we can specify a SPARQL endpoint and a query (it reads endpoint name from 1st line of endpoint.txt)
- p.php processes the the request and displays the results
- endpoint.txt has a preset endpoint name (only 1st line will be read)
